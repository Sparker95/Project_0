When the first AST writes a value to the AST_VAR the other AST sees that change to its input immediately as they both refer to the same underlying value.&nbsp; They also allow the CmdrAction state to be pushed/popped during simulation so that real world actions are not effected.</div></div>",183:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TClass LSQF\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">Base class for ASTs.</div></div>",192:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TClass LSQF\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">The base class for all commander actions. An Action is defined as any behaviour the commander can choose whether to perform.&nbsp; In general the actions are parameterized and scored based on relevance and the commanders current strategy.&nbsp; The scoring can be a complex as required, but in the end is reduced down to a single number that can be used in comparison between actions of the same type, and other types of the same priority level (see CmdrAI for how this works).&nbsp; The behaviour of the action is defined by a state machine, defined by a set of ActionStateTransitions and a set of associated variables (kind of like a blackboard system).&nbsp; Usually one or more pieces of intel will be associated with a CmdrAction to allow them to be discoverable by other commanders.</div></div>",215:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TClass LSQF\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">Models either the real world state, or a derivation of it that can be used for simulation.</div></div>"});
