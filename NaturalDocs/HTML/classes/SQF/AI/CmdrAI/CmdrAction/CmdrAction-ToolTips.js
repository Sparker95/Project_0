When the first AST writes a value to the AST_VAR the other AST sees that change to its input immediately as they both refer to the same underlying value.&nbsp; They also allow the CmdrAction state to be pushed/popped during simulation so that real world actions are not effected.</div></div>",215:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TClass LSQF\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">Models either the real world state, or a derivation of it that can be used for simulation.</div></div>"});
