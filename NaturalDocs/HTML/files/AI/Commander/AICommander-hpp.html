 <div class="CBody"><p>Flags for &lt;Model.WorldModel.new&gt; type parameter.&nbsp; WORLD_TYPE_REAL - Real world model, contained objects represent the last known state of actual garrisons, locations, clusters etc.&nbsp; WORLD_TYPE_SIM_NOW - Sim model with only current effects of actions applied.&nbsp; i.e. Real world model + the effects of any active action that would be applied immediately if the action itself were to update. For instance if the action is to split a garrison in half, it would apply immediately because splitting a garrison is an instantaneous operation. But a move action would not apply because moving takes time.&nbsp; The purpose of this model of the world is mostly to simulate changes in available resources while new actions are being planned. Usually the first part of an action is to allocate its resources (e.g. splitting a detachment off from an existing garrison to perform the action with).&nbsp; WORLD_TYPE_SIM_FUTURE - Sim model with current and future effects of actions applied</p></div>
