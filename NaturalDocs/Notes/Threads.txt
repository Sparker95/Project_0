How to divide code into threads:
1 thread: locations, garrisons and other important non-blocking things.
1 thread per each faction's active AI commander: evaluate all its senses. Plan missions, evaluate goals, create new missions, etc.
1 thread per each faction's reactive AI commander: evaluate all senses and react to them.
1 thread: AI garrison/group/unit goals and senses.
