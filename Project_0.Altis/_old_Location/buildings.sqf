/*
Building positions suitable for specific roles.

Each building position is structered:
	[_buildingPosID, _direction]
		_buildingPosID - number of the building position returned by buildingPos command.
		_direction - hte direction where the unit must be heading relative to the building's position.
	OR it can be specified in cylindrical coordinates relative to building's center:
	[_offset, _offsetDirection, _offsetHeight, _direction]
		_offset - the magnitude of the offset projected onto horizontal plane.
		_offsetDirection - the direction of the offset.
		_offsetHeight - the height of the offset.
		_direction - direction where the unit must be heading relative to the building's position.

The structure of each array with positions for specific type is:
	[[_typesArray, _positionArray], [_typesArray, _positionArray], ...]
		_typesArray - the array of types (typeOf ...) of this building sharing the same building positions. For example, different variants of the same watchtower.
		_positioArray - the array of positions in the form [_buildingPosID, _direction] or [_offset, _offsetDirection, _offsetHeight, _direction]
