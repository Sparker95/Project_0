/*
This function does following:
Takes all vehicles and their crew from _garTransport and combines them into a single group.
Tries to find all the required crew for the vehicles.
If there are more crew units in the vehicle group than needed, they will be moved to a different group.

As a result, in case of success, there should be a a single group with vehicles and their crew capable of moving and fighting. 

_garsCrew will supply drivers for vehicles if they are not assigned yet.

Parameters:
_garsCrew - array of garrisons which can donate crew for vehicles, or a single garrison. It can also include _garTransport.

Return value:
	_nCrewToAdd:
		0 - there is a proper amount of crew in the _garTransport
		>0 (positive) - still need to find this amount of crew units
