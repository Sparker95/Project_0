Tasks

Goals:
Make a system that lets chain behaviours of garrisons in a flexible manner.
Make an abstraction of one garrison performing a specific task.
Make tasks compatible with leaves of behaviour trees, if they will be required in the future.


Things you can do with tasks:
	- Create a task
	- Start a task
	- Stop(interrupt) a task
	
States of tasks
Task can return one of these states: (like behaviour trees)
	- Idle		- before the task was started
	- Success	- after the task has been finished
	- Failure	- after the task has been finished
	- Running	- while the task is running

Work order with tasks:
1. Create
2. Start
3. Periodically query state
4. Stop(interrupt) if needed
5. Start again if needed
	
Task can return the reason of failure.

Examples of tasks:
+ Move - move somewhere
	Parameters:
		- dest. pos.
	Failure conditions:
		- group is dead
		- vehicles are dead
		
+ Load cargo - move and load the other garrison.
	Parameters:
		- the RV pos.
		- the cargo garrison
	Completion conditions: the garrison being transported is still alive and has been delivered to the location.
	Failure conditions:
		- transport group is dead
		- cargo group is dead
	Examples:
		- a convoy garrison carries troops or cargo to a different location
		- a convoy delivers boxes somewhere
		- a helicopter provides air transport to infantry/vehicle
		
+ Get loaded - move to RV pos. and get loaded on the transport garrison's vehicles
	Parameters:
		- the garrison that provides transport
		- the RV pos.
	Completion conditions:
		- the garrison being transported has been delivered by a corresponding 'Provide transport' task.
	Failure conditions:
		- transport group is dead
		- cargo group is dead
	Examples: a garrison with troops needs to be delivered somewhere.
	
+ Unload cargo - move to dest. pos and unload your cargo garrison

+ Get unloaded - get unloaded by the transport garrison
	
+ Attack location - a garrison secures specified area from enemies.
	Parameters: - the position to secure.
	Completion conditions: area secured and no enemies found for XXX seconds.
	Failure conditions:
		- death of the garrison
		- no more reason to attack it
	
+ Perform a single fire mission - a garrison(a group of artillery units) that provides fire support
	Parameters:
		- where to fire?
	Completion ocnditions:
	Failure conditions:
		- death of the group
		- no more ammo
	Examples:
	
+ Merge with garrison - merge with the dest. garrison
	Parameters:
		- garrison to merge with
	Completion conditions:
	Failure conditions:
		- death of the source garrison
		- the dest. garrison has switched side
		
	Examples: reinforcements join garrison of a military base
	
+ Synchronize - an empty task that
