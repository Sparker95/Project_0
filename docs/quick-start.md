# Quick Start Guide

## Install

### For Dedicated Server

Vindicta is installed as a mod *only*, simply install and enable the mod and its dependencies and the mission will be available.

### For Local Hosting or Single Player

Just subscribe to the mod and dependencies (ace and cba) on the Steam Workshop page (linked above), and enable them in the launcher.
To self host just start a server through the MP menu.
To play single player just look for the mission in the SP mission list.

## Starting a New Game

1. Wait for the mission to load
2. Press the U button to bring up the menu
3. Select `CREATE`
4. Specify a `CAMPAIGN NAME`
5. Select `FACTIONS` -- you must have appropriate mods installed or you will get an error
6. Optionally change `INITIAL ENEMY %` -- this specifies how populated the initially held military positions will be
6. Click `START`
7. Wait for the initialization process to complete -- this can take a minute or two
8. You should now be able to select the initial spawn point (a red box) to spawn at.

## Some Tips Before You Start

### Pay attention to your undercover monitor

This will warn you if your actions or appearence are drawing suspicion. Bear in mind that some things 
might not be considered suspicious unless you are being observed directly.

### Experiment with ACE interactions

[ACE Interaction Guide](https://ace3mod.com/wiki/feature/interaction.html).
These can allow you to use the medical system, perform vehicle repairs (and "unrepairs"), carry things like boxes and 
weapons, and load them into vehicles.

### Don't Underestimate the Enemy Commander

He will learn about your movements, and be ruthless in punishing your mistakes. If he finds your secret hide out, he won't 
just "forget about it", he will attack it until either you leave, he wins, or he can no longer send enough forces to have a 
good chance at victory.

### Logistics Are Logical

If you destroy the enemies trucks he will have to go on foot, if you block a route he will have to take another, if you kill a man he is dead.

### Pay Attention To Intel

Knowledge is power -- you can catch wind of enemy locations, and movements hours before they happen, 
giving you the chance to evade, intercept, or ambush.

## Your First Day

Your first main task should be to create a hidden camp where you can start to build your strength.  
To build a camp you need building supplies. The easiest early source of these is police stations, which you will find in most towns.  
You should try talking to the locals to find out what they know, they will be able to tell you if there is a police station in the town.  
Of course the police station will be guarded, so if you can find some means to distract the local police that might make things easier.  
You will need to load your supplies on to something, so you should secure a vehicle (a civilian one unless you want a fight).
Once you have your supplies you should try to escape the area and find somewhere secure and out of the way to set up your first camp.
Beware the enemy patrols roads and towns, and has outposts and bases everywhere. Although you may find an abandonned base, 
the enemy didn't forget about it, they just haven't occupied it yet. If you squat in one of these you can expect a fight soon.
